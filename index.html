              <h2>Who Was Socrates?</h2>
              <ul>
                <li>It was around 470 BCE when Socrates was born in Athens, Greece.</li>
                <li>Socratesâ€™ father was Sophroniscus, a sculptor and stone mason from Athens and his mother was a midwife by the name of Phaenarete.</li>
                <li>He received basic Greek education because he did not belong to a noble family and hence, he learned the skills of his father at a very early age.</li>
                <li>Before turning a philosopher, Socrates took up masonry and sculpting as his profession for several years, as well as serving in the military.</li>
                <li>According to the records of his students named Aristophanes and Xenophon, Socrates used to take money for teaching and that was his only source of income that helped Socrates to sustain a livelihood.</li>
                <li>He traveled across Athens to gain insight from common man and from elite members of society to help him understand ethics and politics more deeply and thoroughly. </li>
                <li>Wasn't focused on questions of the universe - he was focused on ethical questions such as what friendship or justice truly was. </li>
                <li>Believed to have influenced Western Philosophy, logic and dialogues, for example the "Socratic Method".</li>
                <li>Charged with being an atheist and corrupting the youth of Athens, despite claiming to encourage virtue and elevated behaviour.</li>
                <li>Sentenced to death by hemlock poisoning. His followers encouraged him to flee, but Socrates willingly took his sentence.</li>
              </ul>
